# Business Programming Project

**USC Student Companion â„¢** is your personal academic guide that provides the following basic information for each course while a student at the USC. Courses done, grades earned, Course outline attachments, course notes etc.

This is a simple application to keep track of each course you are doing/have done and can serve as a personal exam timetable for the course which has final exams, keep track of your courses that have etc. The concept is like a personal check sheet system blended with a simple exam timetable.

This also solves a problem that often shows up when students have completed their program and need to revert back to data pertaining to their academic life from their viewpoint. Please note this does not replace a transcript, which is an official University Document.
